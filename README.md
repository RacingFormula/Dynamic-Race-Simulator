# Dynamic-Race-Simulator
## Overview
The Dynamic Race Simulator is an advanced simulation tool that allows engineers and strategists to predict race outcomes and optimise strategies. By integrating vehicle dynamics, track modelling, and real-time decision-making capabilities, the simulator provides a comprehensive platform for race scenario analysis and improvement.

### Features:
- **Vehicle Dynamics Modelling**: Simulates acceleration, braking, tyre wear, and energy usage.
- **Track Modelling**: Includes support for variable track layouts, surface conditions, and elevation changes.
- **Strategy Testing**: Enables simulation of pit stops, energy management, and tyre strategy.
- **Customisable Parameters**: Fully configurable to match specific race series and vehicles.
- **Real-Time Visualisation**: Outputs detailed telemetry and graphical insights during simulations.
